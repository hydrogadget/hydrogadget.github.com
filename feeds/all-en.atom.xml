now and we've come up with a dumptruck load of design requirments.  We've pared
it down to a few that we think we can make for the Feb 2nd LV Mini Maker
Faire deadline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be inexpensive to build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must connect to the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must have a sensible and inuitive (web) interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Must minimize waste - be a drop-in replacement for an existing residential
irrigation timer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE BIG ONE:  Be able to communicate with the water district to determine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the HydroGadget team members have been playing around with the Raspberry Pi
platform and we all think it will make an excellent controller for our project.
We originally started to take some inspiration from &lt;a href="http://mightyohm.com/blog/about/"&gt;Jeff
Keyzer's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://mightyohm.com/blog/2008/10/building-a-wifi-radio-part-1-introduction/"&gt;WiFi
Radio&lt;/a&gt;
project.  Jeff did a really good job of documenting this fantastic project and we
could easily see how we could adapt it to fit our needs.  However we decided that
if we wanted to make a production run of these things then using a Wifi router as
our platform would be too wasteful (we'd have to throw away the case and the
router power supply) and it would also be very time consuming to add the required
serial header to the router mainboard.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Hardware Startup"></category><category term="Raspberry Pi"></category></entry><entry><title>HydroGadget: Leaving Our Mark on The Internet of Things</title><link href="http://hydrogadget.org/2012/11/04/hydrogadget-leaving-our-mark-on-the-internet-of-things/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-11-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Brian Munroe</name></author><id>tag:hydrogadget.org,2012-11-04:2012/11/04/hydrogadget-leaving-our-mark-on-the-internet-of-things/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Do tell, what is a HydroGadget?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a while back, I was standing in my garage, middle of the night, trying to figure out how to program
my sprinkler timer to meet the new watering restrictions that the city had inacted
in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to schedule it to water three days a week, twice a day...Ok, that seems
easy enough, right?  Lets see here, what does this dial do...how about this thing
that toggles between program A and B...and then program 1 and 2?...Wait a minute, A and B?
1 and 2?  What on earth does all this mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO DESIGNED THIS THING?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about 30 minutes of fumbling through a crazy interface, I think I got the
timer programmed correctly, or so I hoped...guess I'll have to wait until tomorrow to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a long story short, I lucked out that time, but I seriously wanted to do
something about the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Enter, HydroGadget (and SYN Shop, and Mini-Maker Faire LV, and group of BFFs)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after wandering aimlessly trying to learn microelectronics, I had assembled a
few kits, played with the Arduino -- but I really didn't understand what I was
doing.  I was just following recipes that someone else had designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the upcoming &lt;a href="http://makerfairevegas.com/" title="Las
Vegas Mini Maker Faire"&gt;Las Vegas Mini Maker Faire&lt;/a&gt;, I really wanted to throw my hat into the ring as a
maker.  I'm currently the president of &lt;a href="https://synshop.org/" title="SYN Shop"&gt;SYN Shop&lt;/a&gt;
and I have nothing to show for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulling in a few friends that I work with (Charles and Mike), we all decided that
we'd head down this road together.  We all have about the same level of experience
with electronics but we all think this project sounds interesting and is going to
be a great way to take our electronics skills to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Hardware Startup"></category></entry></feed>
