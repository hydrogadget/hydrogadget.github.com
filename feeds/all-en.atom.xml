Sometimes protoboard builds are not exactly great looking.  This power supply board is a good example.  I’m rather pleased however, how the output board came out.  I couldn’t locate a fuse of the right size so I just dropped a machine screw I had laying around so I could run tests.  The power supply board passed a 1.5A load stress test for a full hour with no signs of distress.  Should be ready to go for Las Vegas Mini Maker Faire!&lt;/p&gt;

This ruled out using any surface mount component and using through hole exclusively.  We also wanted to limit the number of manufacturer specific or single source components we used to make it as easy as possible for people to find parts and avoid the hassle of discontinued components.  All but one of the components are “jellybeans”; meaning they are a generic part that can be sources from many different vendors and manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardware concept is actually quite simple.  Power for the HydroGadget is taken from a 24VacRMS transformer that are standard for irrigation timers as the water valves are typically 24VacRMS.  The 24VacRMS passes through four diodes and a bypass capacitor produce a rectified signal.  This feeds a LM317 variable regulator configured to limit the output to about +34Vdc.  A tiny high efficiency dc to dc switching power regulator then  produces our +5Vdc system power.  I found that even though the transformers typically used all specify 24VacRMS, I found that with only a small load, the secondary voltage can be substantially beyond 24VacRMS.  Little RMS to peak math and found that a typical transformer can spit out as high as 41VacPeak.  The little dc to dc converter I found is great, but can only handle 36Vdc input.  Enter the ever flexible LM317.  With two resistors I can set the output voltage to 34Vdc, which the dc to dc converter can easily tolerate.  The LM317 has a useful little quirk that it is stable even when the input to output voltage difference is below the dropout voltage of about 2Vdc.  When the input voltage is below 36Vdc the output voltage is equal to the input voltage minus the dropout voltage.  So in essence, the LM317 is acting like a voltage limiter for the dc to dc converter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output board is not nearly as interesting.  A ribbon cable connecting the output board to the Raspberry Pi feeds the +5Vdc system power as well as the +3.3Vdc logic out signals from the Pi.  The logic out signals are run through a eight channel Darlington pair IC to minimize the load on the Raspberry Pis GPIO pins.  The Darlington pair IC drives four optocouplers with triac outputs.  These weak triacs then drive a much higher capacity triac which actually switches the 24VacRMS  on and off to the valves.  Besides the inherent safety advantage the optocouplers provide, it also adds flexibility to our design to switch different or higher voltages if someone wants to do that modification.  I’m very curious to see what people end up hacking HydroGadget to do.&lt;/p&gt;

Shop&lt;/a&gt; meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the requirements for the device is to use the existing irrigation
controller power supply.  To use this, we needed to convert the power from 24VAC to
5VDC.  Having never done this before and always up for the challenge, I fired up the internet and tried to determine
what components we needed to build our own power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordering about $10 worth of parts (RF choke?  Whatever that is!) I tried my hand
at assembling the circuit following the data sheet from the DC-DC converter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/kbABb.jpg?sss" alt="" title="Hosted by imgur.com" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After wiring it up, I was too tired and scared to plug it in to test it, so I
waited until the SYN Shop meetup to get a second set of eyes on my circuit.  At
the meetup, my good friend Josh looked over the converter datasheet and my wiring
job, gave me the thumbs up and I plugged it in.  Putting the volt meter on the
output leads....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Zero volts &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awe man, now what is wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started picking apart my circuit, looking for mistakes and trying to confirm
that I hadn't blown a part somewhere along the way.  After about 10 minutes of
doing that and finally throwing my hands up in the air, two SYN Shop regulars, Charley and Nathan came over and started looking at what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charley asked a few basic questions and finally said, "This circuit is way too
sensitive to inductance for you to be using that rat's nest of jumpers.  You need
to use perfboard and much shorter wire lengths".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan confirmed Charley's assessment and retold a story about how he too had
been bitten by this same exact problem.  However, instead of telling me "good
luck!", Nathan went over to his box of components and pulled out an all in one
DC-DC converter, handed it to me and said "Here, just use this"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, instead of this wild mess of wires and various components (I did learn
what the RF choke does!  Thanks Charley!), the HydroGadget power circuit looks
like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://i.imgur.com/lZaf4.jpg" title="Hosted by imgur.com" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lot of back and forth, I decided that the even though it feels like
cheating using this &lt;a href="http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Murata-Power-Solutions/OKI-78SR-5-15-W36-C/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMtwaiKVUtQsNemMZL4TplJBqOl7845nWHA%3d"&gt;fancy-pants

we will suck it up for now...probably :-)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Hardware Startup"></category><category term="Power Supply"></category><category term="Hurt Feelings"></category></entry><entry><title>Fire up Microsoft Project and find a PMP!</title><link href="http://hydrogadget.org/2012/11/19/fire-up-microsoft-project-and-find-a-pmp/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-11-19T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Brian Munroe</name></author><id>tag:hydrogadget.org,2012-11-19:2012/11/19/fire-up-microsoft-project-and-find-a-pmp/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok, not really...but Charles, Mike and myself have been meeting on a regular basis for about a month
now and we've come up with a dump truck load of design requirements.  We've pared
it down to a few that we think we can make for the Feb 2nd LV Mini Maker
Faire deadline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Phase One Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be inexpensive to build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must have a sensible and intuitive web / mobile interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must minimize waste - should act as a drop-in replacement for an existing residential
irrigation timer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;THE BIG ONE:  Must be able to communicate with the water utility to determine
the water restriction schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these requirements are pretty straightforward, but #4 is the most exciting
to me.  Before starting this project, I googled around and found plenty of DIY
sprinkler controllers, but none of them had the ability to communicate with a
third party.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in Southern Nevada (namely, Las Vegas), we have mandatory drought restriction
watering schedules.  These change about three times a year and usually
customers are notified via a postcard to adjust them.  People sometimes ignore the
notices, but most of the time, people just get busy and forget to change their schedules, even
with the reminder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the HydroGadget, we want to eliminate this by allowing the system to continually poll the water utility to determine the restriction schedule.  It then would either adjust things automatically or at least send an email / SMS reminder that things need to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think this will be something that the water utility would be really interested
in as well.  Eliminating water waste is easy once it is highly automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we'd like to use the HydroGadget as a demonstration platform for
showing how valuable public data APIs are.  Our phase one plans are to screen
scrape the water utility's website to determine the restriction schedule, but
eventually we'd like to work with them to develop a web API that the HydroGadget
and other devices could leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Choosing Hardware for the Controller&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as choosing a platform, the HydroGadget team members have been playing around with the &lt;a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/"&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; and we all think it will make an excellent controller for our project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We originally started to take some inspiration from &lt;a href="http://mightyohm.com/blog/about/"&gt;Jeff
Keyzer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://mightyohm.com/blog/2008/10/building-a-wifi-radio-part-1-introduction/"&gt;WiFi
Radio&lt;/a&gt;
project.  Jeff did a really excellent job of documenting his build and we
could easily see how it could be adapted to fit our project.  However we decided that
if we wanted to make a production run of these things then using a wireless router as
our platform would be too wasteful.  Assuming we did everything locally, we'd have to throw away the case and the
router power supply plus it would be very time consuming to add the required
serial header to the router mainboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi is a very inexpensive (~$35US) and low power ARM based computer that runs Linux
and has enough general purpose Input-Output (GPIO) that we can control the
sprinkler valve solenoids without having to add a lot of extra components.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Hardware Startup"></category><category term="Raspberry Pi"></category></entry><entry><title>HydroGadget: Leaving Our Mark on The Internet of Things</title><link href="http://hydrogadget.org/2012/11/04/hydrogadget-leaving-our-mark-on-the-internet-of-things/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-11-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Brian Munroe</name></author><id>tag:hydrogadget.org,2012-11-04:2012/11/04/hydrogadget-leaving-our-mark-on-the-internet-of-things/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Do tell, what is a HydroGadget?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a while back, I was standing in my garage, freezing in the middle of the night, trying to figure out how to program
my sprinkler timer to meet the new watering restrictions that the city had enacted in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to schedule it to water three days a week, twice a day...Ok, that seems
easy enough, right?  Lets see here, what does this dial do...how about this thing
that toggles between program A and B...and then program 1 and 2?...Wait a minute, A and B?
1 and 2?  What on earth does all this mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO DESIGNED THIS THING?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about 30 minutes of fumbling through a crazy interface, I think I got the
timer programmed correctly, or so I hoped...guess I'll have to wait until tomorrow to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a long story short, I lucked out that time, but I seriously wanted to do
something about the interface.  And while I'm at it, it there a way to make it so
that it changes itself when then watering restriction changes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Enter, HydroGadget (and SYN Shop, and Mini-Maker Faire LV, and a group of BFFs)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after wandering aimlessly trying to learn microelectronics, I had assembled a
few kits, played with the Arduino -- but I really didn't understand what I was
doing.  I was just following recipes that someone else had designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the upcoming &lt;a href="http://makerfairevegas.com/" title="Las
Vegas Mini Maker Faire"&gt;Las Vegas Mini Maker Faire&lt;/a&gt;, I really wanted to throw my hat into the ring as a
maker.  I'm currently the president of the local hackerspace, &lt;a href="https://synshop.org/" title="SYN Shop"&gt;SYN Shop&lt;/a&gt;
and I have nothing to show for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulling in a few friends that I work with (Charles and Mike), we all decided that
we'd head down this road together.  I pitched the idea of the HydroGadget to them
and they both immediately started coming up with ways to make it every more
awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have about the same level of electronics experience and we all agreed that
the only way to take our electronics skills to the next level would be to throw
ourselves into a project that would make us step out of our comfort zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more kits for us!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Hardware Startup"></category></entry></feed>
