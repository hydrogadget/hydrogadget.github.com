Shop&lt;/a&gt; meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the requirements for the device is to use the existing irrigation
controller power supply.  To use this, we needed to convert the power from 24VAC to
5VDC.  Having never done this before and always up for the challenge, I fired up the internet and tried to determine
what components we needed to build our own power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordering about $16 worth of parts (RF choke?  Whatever that is!) I tried my hand
at assembling the circuit following the data sheet from the DC-DC converter.&lt;/p&gt;

now and we've come up with a dumptruck load of design requirments.  We've pared
it down to a few that we think we can make for the Feb 2nd LV Mini Maker
Faire deadline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Phase One Reqirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be inexpensive to build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must have a sensible and inuitive (web/mobile) interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must minimize waste - should act as a drop-in replacement for an existing residential
irrigation timer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;THE BIG ONE:  Must be able to communicate with the public utility to determine
water restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these requirements are pretty straightforward, but #4 is the most exciting
to me.  Before starting this project, I googled around and found plenty of DIY
sprinkler controllers, but none of them had the ability to communicate with a
third party.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in Southern Nevada (namely, Las Vegas), we have mandatory drought restriction
watering schedules.  These change on a quarterly basis and usually
customers are notifed via a postcard to change their watering schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the HydroGadget, we want to elimate this hassle by allowing the system to
determine the restriction schedule and either adjust things automatically or
at least send an email / SMS reminder that things need to be adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Choosing Hardware for the Controller&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as choosing a platform, the HydroGadget team members have been playing around with the &lt;a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/"&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; and we all think it will make an excellent controller for our project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We originally started to take some inspiration from &lt;a href="http://mightyohm.com/blog/about/"&gt;Jeff
Keyzer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://mightyohm.com/blog/2008/10/building-a-wifi-radio-part-1-introduction/"&gt;WiFi
Radio&lt;/a&gt;
project.  Jeff did a really good job of documenting this fantastic project and we
could easily see how it could be adapted to fit our project.  However we decided that
if we wanted to make a production run of these things then using a Wifi router as
our platform would be too wasteful (we'd have to throw away the case and the
router power supply) and it would also be very time consuming to add the required
serial header to the router mainboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi is a very inexpensive (~$35US) and low power ARM based computer that runs Linux
and has enough general purpose Input-Output (GPIO) that we can control the
sprinkler valve solenoids without having to add a lot of extra components.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Hardware Startup"></category><category term="Raspberry Pi"></category></entry><entry><title>HydroGadget: Leaving Our Mark on The Internet of Things</title><link href="http://hydrogadget.org/2012/11/04/hydrogadget-leaving-our-mark-on-the-internet-of-things/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-11-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Brian Munroe</name></author><id>tag:hydrogadget.org,2012-11-04:2012/11/04/hydrogadget-leaving-our-mark-on-the-internet-of-things/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Do tell, what is a HydroGadget?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a while back, I was standing in my garage, middle of the night, trying to figure out how to program
my sprinkler timer to meet the new watering restrictions that the city had inacted
in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to schedule it to water three days a week, twice a day...Ok, that seems
easy enough, right?  Lets see here, what does this dial do...how about this thing
that toggles between program A and B...and then program 1 and 2?...Wait a minute, A and B?
1 and 2?  What on earth does all this mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO DESIGNED THIS THING?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about 30 minutes of fumbling through a crazy interface, I think I got the
timer programmed correctly, or so I hoped...guess I'll have to wait until tomorrow to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a long story short, I lucked out that time, but I seriously wanted to do
something about the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Enter, HydroGadget (and SYN Shop, and Mini-Maker Faire LV, and group of BFFs)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after wandering aimlessly trying to learn microelectronics, I had assembled a
few kits, played with the Arduino -- but I really didn't understand what I was
doing.  I was just following recipes that someone else had designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the upcoming &lt;a href="http://makerfairevegas.com/" title="Las
Vegas Mini Maker Faire"&gt;Las Vegas Mini Maker Faire&lt;/a&gt;, I really wanted to throw my hat into the ring as a
maker.  I'm currently the president of &lt;a href="https://synshop.org/" title="SYN Shop"&gt;SYN Shop&lt;/a&gt;
and I have nothing to show for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulling in a few friends that I work with (Charles and Mike), we all decided that
we'd head down this road together.  We all have about the same level of experience
with electronics but we all think this project sounds interesting and is going to
be a great way to take our electronics skills to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Hardware Startup"></category></entry></feed>
