&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A personal commentary by one the HydroGadget team member&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a while back, I was standing in my garage, middle of the night, trying to figure out how to program
my sprinkler timer to meet the new watering restrictions that the city had inacted
in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to schedule it to water three days a week, twice a day...Ok, that seems
easy enough, right?  Lets see here, what does this dial do...how about this thing
that toggles between program A and B...and then program 1 and 2?...Wait a minute, A and B?
1 and 2?  What on earth does all this mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO DESIGNED THIS THING?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about 30 minutes of fumbling through a crazy interface, I think I got the
timer programmed correctly, or so I hope...guess I'll have to wait until tomorrow to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a long story short, I lucked out that time, but I seriously wanted to do
something about the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Enter, HydroGadget (and SYN Shop, and Mini-Maker Faire LV, and Unicorns)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time I had really gotten interested in learning more about
microelectronics.  The Arduino had started to become popular and entry level
electronics had never been easier to work with.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Hardware Startup"></category></entry></feed>
