</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I think it is safe to say that plenty of people were very excited to see
HydroGadget in a form other then a) a mess of wires and blown up components
and b) more then just hot air about a non existent project.</p>
<p><img src="http://smokingcircuits.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_0752.jpg?w=250&h=187" alt="" title="Hosted by imgur.com" /></p>
<p>A HUGE thanks to <a href="http://smokingcircuits.me/">Eric</a> for taking over the
electronics.  That power supply was a tricky little guy.  Luckily for us, Eric
worked through a lunch break and produced something that didn't constantly let out
the blue smoke and / or destroy the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>People were genuinely excited about it.  I explained the reason why I decided to
scratch this itch and I found that people were actively agreeing with me to the
point of wanting to buy the prototype as is.</p>
<p>I'm not 100% sure it is clear from the previous blog posts as to why we decided
to do this.  So I'll recap a little:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Build A Better Interface - Now I'm no Jacob Nielson, but I knew I could build a better interface then the existing one.  HydroGadget was born out of frustration trying to use a bizzaro user interface that not even my landscaper could figure out (seriously).  I followed the natural progression of things and decided it should be a web app for sure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Water Conservation - In Nevada we have drought restriction schedules that have to be followed, otherwise you run the risk of being fined or shamed into compliance by your neighbors.  The schedules change about every quarter and I know that a lot of people usually forget.  Since the device is connected to the internet already, it would be rather trivial to make it location aware.  By doing so, it could now query the local water utility to determine the correct drought restriction schedule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice What I Preach - As one of the founders of <a href="http://synshop.org">SYN Shop</a> I constantly speak to people about making and failure and learning and collaboration all the time.  I figure I better put up or shut up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also got very re-invigorated about this project after reading Chris Anderson's Book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Makers-The-New-Industrial-Revolution/dp/0307720950">Makers: The Next Industrial Revolution</a>. The crazy thing is, the book starts off talking about irrigation timers and how he collaborated with Ray (sorry Ray, I don't know your last name) to build <a href="http://www.opensprinkler.com/">OpenSprinkler</a>.  I met Ray at the 2012 Makerfaire San Mateo and I talked a little bit about my requirements.  I suppose I could have borrowed from his design, but HydroGadget was supposed initially be a learning exercise.</p>
<p>We have a great team and MMF LV was a huge eye opening experience for us.  Tons of suggestions, feature requests, collaborations.  I figured one or two people would be interested, but the design points really struck a chord with makerfaire attendees, much to my surpise.  We are taking a little breather, but definitely going to regroup and figure out what our next step is very soon.</p>
<p>If you are interested in keeping informed about the progress of HydroGadget, <a href="http://hydrogadget.org/info/">please take this little survey</a> and we'll be in touch soon.</p>
