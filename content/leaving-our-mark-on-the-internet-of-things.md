Do tell, what is a HydroGadget?
===

So a while back, I was standing in my garage, freezing in the middle of the night, trying to figure out how to program
my sprinkler timer to meet the new watering restrictions that the city had inacted in Las Vegas.


I wanted to schedule it to water three days a week, twice a day...Ok, that seems
easy enough, right?  Lets see here, what does this dial do...how about this thing
that toggles between program A and B...and then program 1 and 2?...Wait a minute, A and B?
1 and 2?  What on earth does all this mean?


**WHO DESIGNED THIS THING?**


After about 30 minutes of fumbling through a crazy interface, I think I got the
timer programmed correctly, or so I hoped...guess I'll have to wait until tomorrow to find out.

To make a long story short, I lucked out that time, but I seriously wanted to do
something about the interface.  And while I'm at it, it there a way to make it so
that it changes itself when then watering restriction changes?


Enter, HydroGadget (and SYN Shop, and Mini-Maker Faire LV, and a group of BFFs)

So after wandering aimlessly trying to learn microelectronics, I had assembled a
few kits, played with the Arduino -- but I really didn't understand what I was
doing.  I was just following recipes that someone else had designed.


With the upcoming [Las Vegas Mini Maker Faire](http://makerfairevegas.com/ "Las
Vegas Mini Maker Faire"), I really wanted to throw my hat into the ring as a
maker.  I'm currently the president of the local hackerspace, [SYN Shop](https://synshop.org/ "SYN Shop")
and I have nothing to show for myself.


Pulling in a few friends that I work with (Charles and Mike), we all decided that
we'd head down this road together.  I pitched the idea of the HydroGadget to them
and they both immediately started coming up with ways to make it every more
awesome!


We all have about the same level of electronics experience and we all agreed that
the only way to take our electronics skills to the next level would be to throw
ourselves into a project that would make us step out of our comfort zones.


No more kits for us!
