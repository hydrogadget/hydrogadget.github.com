We got our first lesson in electical engineering 101 at last night's [SYN
Shop](https://synshop.org) meetup.


One of the requirements for the device is to use the existing irrigation
controller power supply.  To use this, we needed to convert the power from 24VAC to
5VDC.  Having never done this before and always up for the challenge, I fired up the internet and tried to determine
what components we needed to build our own power supply.


Ordering about $16 worth of parts (RF choke?  Whatever that is!) I tried my hand
at assembling the circuit following the data sheet from the DC-DC converter.
