Title: HydroGadget Protoboard Build

It’s alive! Sometimes protoboard builds are not exactly great looking.  This power supply board is a good example.  I’m rather pleased however, how the output board came out.  I couldn’t locate a fuse of the right size so I just dropped a machine screw I had laying around so I could run tests.  The power supply board passed a 1.5A load stress test for a full hour with no signs of distress.  Should be ready to go for Las Vegas Mini Maker Faire!
